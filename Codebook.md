This repository includes all the files for week 4's project of the Getting and Cleaning Data course. In particular, the goal of the project is to create a tidy data set of [wearable computing data](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones). The tidy data set is produced through an R script called **run_analysis.R**. The data used for this project must be downloaded from a [url](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) in the form of a **zip file**.  In order to create the tidy data set the following goals must be acomplished:

- Merge two datasets to create one data set
- Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
- Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.
- From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
