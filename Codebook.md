This repository includes all the files for week 4's project of the Getting and Cleaning Data course. In particular, the goal of the project is to create a tidy data set of [wearable computing data](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones). The tidy data set is produced through an R script called **run_analysis.R**. The data used for this project must be downloaded from a [url](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) in the form of a **zip file**.  In order to create the tidy data set the following goals must be acomplished:

1.Merge two datasets to create one data set.
2.Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3.Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.
5.From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
