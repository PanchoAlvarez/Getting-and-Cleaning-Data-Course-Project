This repository includes all the files for week 4's project of the Getting and Cleaning Data course. In particular, the goal of the project is to create a tidy data set of [wearable computing data](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones). The tidy data set is produced through an R script called **run_analysis.R**.
